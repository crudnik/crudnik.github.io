## Intro

In this process of learning and sharing, part of the learning in only reading articles 
to keep up with the news in this field. Reading is great, but to go a step further and 
really assimilate the information, what a better way to learn than writting about it 
and trying to explain the relevant knowledge to somebody else?

With this in mind I'll try to explain what strikes me or seems particularly interesting.
