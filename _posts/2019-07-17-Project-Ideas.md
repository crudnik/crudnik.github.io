## Intro

As I start this "journey", I think the best way to stay on track and motivated is actually to make a list!
So here we go, let's just do that.

## My Projects

1. ~~building my own blog~~

   It's not perfect, but I did it anyway :)  

1. Can I predict the price of a house in a paticular city from his description and some quantitive data such as sqm?

   As I see it right now, I'll first try to find some easily accessible data, and start from there.  

2. Do a chatbot based on my whatsapp Engineering School group

3. to be continued...

## Technical (or not) skills
