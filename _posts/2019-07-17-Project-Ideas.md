## My Projects

1. ~~building my own blog~~
... I's not perfect, but I did it anyway :)

1. Can I predict the price of a house in a paticular city from his description and some quantitive data such as sqm?

... As I see it right now, I'll first try to find some easily accessible data, and start from there.
